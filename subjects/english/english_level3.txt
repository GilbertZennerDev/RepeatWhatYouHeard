**1. Inversion for Emphasis:** Rewrite the following two sentences by using **inversion** to put the negative adverbial phrase at the beginning for maximum emphasis:
* I **had never seen** such a beautiful sunset.
* They **didn't realise** the danger until it was too late.
**=END=**

**2. The Participle Clause Reduction:** Condense the following two complex sentences into one concise sentence each, using a **Participle Clause** (e.g., *Having finished*, *Realising*):
* Because she had worked all night, she felt exhausted.
* As he waited for the train, he read the newspaper.
**=END=**

**3. Mixed Conditional Nuance (Type 3 & 2):** Write one sentence using a **Mixed Conditional** structure: The *if-clause* must use **Type 3** (past hypothetical), and the *main clause* must use **Type 2** (present consequence) to show how a past action affects the present.
**=END=**

**4. Cleft Sentence Focus:** Use a **Cleft Sentence** starting with ***"It was..."*** to focus specifically on the **time** and then on the **reason** in the following base statement:
* I realised my mistake **when I saw the evidence**.
**=END=**

**5. The 'Would Rather/Sooner' Request:** Write a sentence using **"I would rather/sooner"** to express a preference about a **past action** of **another person**. Note the necessary use of the **Past Perfect** tense within the clause (e.g., *I'd rather you had told me...*).
**=END=**

**6. Complex Future Perfect Continuous:** Write a single sentence using the **Future Perfect Continuous** tense to describe an activity. The sentence must also include a subordinate clause beginning with ***"provided that..."*** (or a similar concessive conjunction) to establish a condition.
**=END=**

**7. Stylistic Substitution:** Rewrite the following sentence, replacing the simple conjunction **"and"** with a more sophisticated linking phrase that expresses **addition and contrast** simultaneously (*whereas, whilst, moreover* etc.):
* The city is beautiful, **and** it is quite polluted.
**=END=**

**8. The Double Prepositional Verb:** Write a single, grammatically correct sentence that contains **two different verbs** which are each followed by a **fixed, mandatory preposition** (e.g., *depend on, account for, consist of*).
**=END=**

**9. The Emphatic 'Do/Did':** Write a response to a statement that denies a past action (e.g., *You didn't study for the test.*). Your response must strongly affirm the action by using the **emphatic auxiliary 'did'** with the main verb.
**=END=**

**10. Nominalisation for Formality:** Rewrite the following three simple sentences into **one complex sentence** using **Nominalisation** (turning verbs or adjectives into nouns) to achieve a highly formal tone:
* The company decided to expand.
* This caused success.
* The success was unexpected.
**=END=**
